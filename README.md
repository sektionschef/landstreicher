# Landstreicher

A couple of strokes wandering through the landscapes. 

The space is randomly cut in segments on both axis. Some of the resulting rectangles are randomly selected to merge and pair. Another layer is created with the same recipe and set on top.
* the basic stroke size is randomly chosen but somehow distorted for each line.
* the spacing between the strokes is realtive to the global stroke size
* the speed ot the strokes is randomly chosen for each line
* stroke color is randomly distorted
* background grain is random

It features a set of 12 color palettes. 

100% generative, without pngs. The repo of the code is published here: https://github.com/sektionschef/landstreicher
