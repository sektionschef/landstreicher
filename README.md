# Landstreicher

A couple of strokes wandering through the landscapes. 

The space is randomly cut in segments and some are randomly selected to merge. A second layer is created with the same recipe and set on top.
* the basic stroke size is randomly chosen but somehow distorted for each line.
* the spacing between the strokes is realtive to the global stroke size
* the speed ot the strokes is randomly chosen for each line
* stroke color is randomly distorted

It features a set of 12 color palettes. 

100% generative, without pngs. The repo of the code is published here: https://github.com/sektionschef/landstreicher
