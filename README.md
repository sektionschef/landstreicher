# Landstreicher

A couple of strokes wandering through the landscapes.

The space is randomly cut in segments on both axis. Some of the resulting rectangles are randomly selected to be paired. A second layer with similar ingredients is placed on top.

* stroke size is randomly chosen and gets distorted along the way
* spacing between the hatches at the start is relative to the stroke size
* speed ot the strokes is randomly chosen for each line
* stroke color is randomly distorted
* the background noise is randomly generated
* 12 palettes with 2 colors

100% generative, no pngs. The source code is published here: https://github.com/sektionschef/landstreicher
